# ITS-200-Project
Ideas: 


  NFL(Choosing 1 team and providing background information and statistics?) The different color CSS can be made to match the NFL team color
  
  Focusing on an NFL player and if they played on different teams we can change colors of text for each team and analyze how he did on each team?
  
  Things related to our ITS 150 papers? 
  
  I thought of even writing a site in spanish but that will probably be too much. Not sure what it would be written as either.
