            <p>Throughout his time with the New York Giants, Odell Beckham Jr. was named to the probowl for his first 3 seasons. <br> 
                Odell Beckham Jr. gained a lot of experiences and he was able to create bonds and work as a team professionally. <br> 
                The New York Giants traded Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns after 5 seasons, and it had nothing to do with his <br> 
                statistics according to the New York Post. The Giants wanted less energy within the team as the New York Giants had trouble <br> 
                keeping up with Odell Beckham Jr. (par.3).</p>

            <p> When it comes to Odell Beckham Jr's performance with the New York Giants, Odell Beckham Jr. suffered a <br> hamstring injury and a left ankle injury that caused
                Odell Beckham Jr to miss multiple games during the <br> 2014 and 2017 NFL seasons. Odell Beckham Jr also missed some games because of a quad injury, which caused him to <br>
                miss the last few games of the 2018 NFL season (Sporting News, par.5). When looking at Odell Beckham Jr's <br> statistics with the New York Giants, his catch percentage
                range was between 60 and 70 percent, <br> but Odell had a better catch percentage when he first started with the New York Giants rather than before he was
                <br> traded to the Cleveland Browns. Odell Beckham Jr's total yardage with the New York Giants was highest when he <br> first started with the team. The statistics
                that covers his yardage total in rushing yards could be skewed as he did <br> suffer injuries that put him out for most of multiple seasons. Odell Beckham Jr. 's yards
                per game was once again really <br> high when he began his career with the New York Giants, but his yards per game stayed fairly even mainly within the 80's.

            end his season with the Cleveland Browns because he tore his ACL. About halfway through his 2021 season with the Cleveland Browns, <br> 
            Odell Beckham Jr. was released from the Cleveland Browns and he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams. Odell Beckham Jr. has been <br> 
            wanting to play for an NFL team on the west coast, according to Sports News.</p>

            <p>When looking at Odell Beckham Jr's performance with the Cleveland Browns, Odell's statistics may be skewed because the <br> 
            Cleveland Browns did not give him a lot of opportunities with the ball during games. Odell Beckham Jr. was also out with and ACL injury. <br> 
            Odell Beckham Jr's catch percentage with the Cleveland Browns from 2019 to 2021 was around 50 percent. Odell Beckham Jr's yardage <br>

            Odell Beckham Jr. got hurt during the first quarter of the game and he tore his other ACL. The Los Angeles Rams also ended up <br>

           Odell Beckham Jr. would like to play for the Los Angeles Rams in the 2022 NFL season (Rams Digest, par. 2). Odell Beckham Jr. <br>

        During the 2021 NFL season, Odell Beckham Jr. has a catch percentage of 56 percent. Odell Beckham Jr's yards per game is also a <br>
